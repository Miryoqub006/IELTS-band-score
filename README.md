## IELTS Band Score Calculation

IELTS band scores are calculated based on the total number of correct answers in each test section. The scores are then averaged to determine the overall band score.

- **Listening**: 7
- **Reading**: 6.5
- **Writing**: 7
- **Speaking**: 8

The overall band score can be calculated as follows:
(7 + 6.5 + 7 + 8) / 4 = 28.5 / 4 = 7.125

Therefore, the overall band score is rounded to the nearest 0.5, resulting in a score of 7.
